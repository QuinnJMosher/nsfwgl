The last time I had a project in openGL I left it knowing how to do exactly what I had been shown and not knowing at all
how they worked. After this project I now understand the idea of computer memory and video memoy and the differences in how
they are managed, as well as how shaders can be used to efficently draw large numbers of items, lights particles and how to
apply effects to all of them. I ran into a major issue towards the end with view dependency on my light, this was never 
acutally solved and forced a small refactor though the refactor allowed a good quick review and the search made me more
familiar with the codebase that was working. Were I given the project agin I would make sure to consider the rendering as a
whole as apposed to the part by part way working with tutorials forced me to work in;
